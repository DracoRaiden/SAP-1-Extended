# SAP-1 Extended (8-bit CPU with ALU)

An extension of the traditional SAP-1 microprocessor, this project integrates a **Verilog-based ALU** capable of **16 different arithmetic and logical operations**. The design was validated through waveform simulations and digital circuit verification.

## Objective

* Design a digital CPU with extended instruction support  
* Integrate Verilog-coded ALU into the SAP-1 model  
* Simulate using Proteus and waveform analysis  
* Bridge COAL theory with hardware design

## Technologies

* Verilog (Hardware Description Language)  
* Proteus (for circuit simulation)

## Contributions

Worked collaboratively on instruction decoding, datapath simulation, and writing reusable Verilog modules.
